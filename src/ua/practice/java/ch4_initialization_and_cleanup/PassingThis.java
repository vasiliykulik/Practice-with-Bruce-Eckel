    Apple needs to call Peeler.peel( ), which is a foreign utility method that performs an
        operation that, for some reason, needs to be external to Apple (perhaps the external method
        can be applied across many different classes, and you donâ€™t want to repeat the code). To pass
        itself to the foreign method, it must use this*/
